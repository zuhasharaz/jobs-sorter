**JOBS SORTER**

**The Challenge**

- The function which I have created takes jobs as an input.
- The jobs can only be completed if the job it is dependant on, is completed first in the jobs collection.
- The function returns the jobs in order depending on the order in which they have been completed first.

##Process

The string input is converted into an object which is used to loop through to check if the key is the same value as 
the key value pair.
If the job has no dependencies and is not in the final array then it is pushed into the orderedJobs array.
If however, a job does have a dependency and the key and key value pair are in the array, it returns an error message 
that jobs cant have depend on themselves.
If there are no keys and key value pairs in the final array, then they are pushed into the orderedJobs array in the
correct job order.
